body: "<p>The original purpose of this site was to create a Gatsby site with a data
  source I'm not familiar with. But then I thought that I could also try to start
  writing about various things. We'll see how that goes, hopefully I'll get some content
  out.</p><p>The cat section will contain blogging mostly of my two cats, Lumia and
  Osiris, at least for now.</p><p>The life section will contain blogging about things
  relating to mental health and other stuff related to life in general.</p><p>And
  the tech section might some day contain some more technical stuff.</p>"
