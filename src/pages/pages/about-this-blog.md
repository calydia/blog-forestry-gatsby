body: "<p>The original purpose of this site was just to create a Gatsby site with
  a data source I'm not familiar with. But then I thought that I could also try to
  start writing about various things. We'll see how that goes, hopefully I'll get
  some content out.</p><p>The cat section will contain posts mostly of my two cats,
  Lumia and Osiris, at least for now.</p><p>The life section will contain posts about
  things relating to mental health and other stuff related to life in general. I don't
  really know yet.</p><p>And the tech section might some day contain some more technical
  stuff.</p>"
