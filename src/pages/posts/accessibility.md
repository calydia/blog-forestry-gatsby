body: <p>I've been thinking a lot about accessibility lately, especially from the
  point of view of websites (because creating websites is my job). You could say that
  I've finally seen the light regarding accessibility, and I think everything should
  be as accessible as possible.</p><p>I've heard many people say that their website
  won't be accessible because it doesn't have to be. I can’t understand why people
  are excluding people from accessing their content on purpose. I think it's bad practice
  and UX design. But at least here in Finland, the talk about accessibility has increased
  a lot and a lot of agencies have advertised that they do everything accessible by
  default. This is great and I hope the rest of the companies will soon do the same.
  It’s our job digital agencies to inform our clients about accessibility if by some
  chance they don’t understand what it means. It’s in everyone’s interests to have
  as much of the internet as accessible as possible.</p><p>Accessibility doesn't have
  to be hard. Yes, of course at the beginning it can take a little bit more work to
  get used to the new ways of thinking, but that's the way with all new things you
  learn. Why is it ok to not improve with accessibility when you need and want to
  constantly improve with your coding skills or design skills or whatever skills you
  require at the job you do. I will admit that when I first heard the letters WCAG,
  I thought that oh no, this will be something super hard. But it wasn’t, I had just
  somehow gotten into my head that accessibility would automatically mean huge changes
  and my whole way of working would have to change. I was wrong, my way of working
  at that time was already taking care of many accessibility aspects, I just hadn’t
  realized it or even thought about it. I believe the same kind of thoughts and fears
  might be running in the heads of the people who feel accessibility is somehow a
  negative thing.</p><h2>Accessibility and design</h2><p>Accessibility does not automatically
  mean ugly design. I hear a lot of mocking the design of sites that are accessible.
  It’s ok to not like the designs but to blame accessibility for it feels a bit silly
  to me. It's possible to create beautiful things while still making sure everything
  is accessible. It might require a little bit different creativity than before but
  if it feels impossible to create a design that takes even contrast into account,
  I think you have a problem your way of thinking.</p><p>A little pet peeve of mine
  is the issue with contrast. I can accept is you can’t quite hit the requirements
  with contrast everywhere on the websites where accessibility is not “necessary”,
  but I’ve seen content with 1.0 contrast or less. My eyes are ok, and I don’t have
  difficulties with seeing colors and with my good quality monitor even I have difficulties
  in reading such contents at my normal pace. It annoys me. If the design is suddenly
  bad after adding more contrast, a reality check is needed.</p><p>The accessibility
  specs say that accessible websites need to be easy to use. I feel this should always
  be the goal of any website, no matter whether we are thinking about accessibility
  as a whole or not. If users cannot navigate your website, it means they will most
  likely leave your site find other websites that they can use properly. This is something
  I always do very quickly. If a site is hard to navigate or if the information I
  seek is hidden behind multiple levels of content or fancy visual nonsense, I leave
  and never come back.</p><h2>Accessibility and website technical implementation</h2><p>I’ve
  also heard sentences like “But the client won’t create accessible content anyway,
  so there is no point in investing in accessibility in this project”. This is so
  wrong. Even if the content wouldn’t be perfectly accessible, why wouldn’t it make
  a big difference to have the website itself as accessible as possible? You should
  always make sure as much of the site is accessible as possible. If you are a developer
  and you get the site layout from a visual designer, you can’t necessarily affect
  things like contrast or element positioning of the site. But even then, there are
  things you can do, for example, you can make sure people can navigate the site with
  a keyboard.</p><h2>Accessibility tools</h2><p>A lot of accessibility testing needs
  to be done manually. But there are some tools to help with checking contrasts, heading
  structures, link texts, and so on. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" title="">A
  good list of all kinds of accessibility testing tools is found on the WC3’s Web
  Accessibility Initiative site</a>. There are also resources for designers, developers,
  and content writers among others. There is a lot of content about accessibility
  online.</p><p> </p><p>Considering how many people have difficulties accessing websites
  today, it makes me sad that there still are people who don't create accessible designs
  and functionalities on purpose. My main arm is currently sore, and it has gotten
  me thinking about how many of the sites I currently regularly use, would I be able
  to use without my right hand on the mouse. Some of them for sure, but definitely
  not all of them.</p><p>I still have a lot to learn on accessibility and I'm not
  doing things perfectly. But I'm trying and willing to learn. The more inclusive
  we are, the better the world will be for all of us.</p>
