body: "<p>I created two versions of my portfolio. With the first one I wanted to try
  out Gatsby for the first time. And at a tech meetup during the summer I heard people
  talking about having Drupal as a data source. As a Drupal developer, I wanted to
  give it a go.</p><p>After starting the project I desided to use the Drupal as its
  own as well. Because it would give me the opportunity to compare working with only
  Drupal and working with more modern solutions.</p><p></p><ul><li><p></p></li><li><p>speed
