body: "<p>I created two versions of my portfolio. With the first one, I wanted to
  try out Gatsby for the first time. And at a tech meet up during the summer I heard
  people talking about having Drupal as a data source for Gatsby. As a Drupal developer,
  I wanted to give it a go. That way I could focus my learning on Gatsby.</p><p>After
  starting the project, I decided to use the Drupal as its own as well. Because it
  would give me the opportunity to compare working with only Drupal and working with
  more modern solutions.</p><p>Developing both sites was relatively easy since I could
  plan my content and site structure to be simple. And I prefer simpler solutions,
  anyway. There were some problems with getting the local environment up and running
  and the Drupal installed. Luckily my fiancé was around to help me with those issues.
  He is an expert with Docker and pretty much all kinds of things on the server-side.
  Gatsby's installation was a much easier. And one thing I love about Gatsby is its
  excellent documentation. Most of the documentation is very newbie friendly.</p><p>The
  big difference came when it was time to host the sites. I outsourced the hosting
  setup to my fiancé. He fought with the setup for days, trying to make it as good
  as possible without too many compromises. For the Gatsby it was just to put the
  built site to the same server, no special setups needed. The difficulties with the
  Drupal site were mostly because of PHP. I had originally planned to set up the Gatsby
  version on Netlify, but he suggested it could coexist with the Drupal site. That
  way I could also better see the differences in the sites' speed and all those juicy
  bits. It was a good idea so that became the plan.</p><p>The Lighthouse audit results
  on my local machine have huge differences in performance. The Drupal version got
  37(mobile) and 38(desktop) on perfomance while the Gatsby version 100 on both. The
  Drupal is running with Docker4Drupal setup.</p><p>On the server the Drupal version
  got 100 points in performance. So good job on the hosting side of things.</p>"
