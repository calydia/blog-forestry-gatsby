body: "<p>I created two versions of my portfolio. With the first one, I wanted to
  try out Gatsby for the first time. And at a tech&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;during the summer
  I heard people talking about having Drupal as a data source for Gatsby. As a Drupal
  developer, I wanted to give it a go. That way I could focus my learning on Gatsby.</p><p>After&nbsp;starting
  the project, I&nbsp;decided to use&nbsp;the Drupal as its own&nbsp;as well. Because
  it would give me the opportunity to compare working with only Drupal and working
  with more modern solutions.</p><p>Developing both sites was relatively easy since
  I could plan my content and site structure to be&nbsp;simple. And I prefer&nbsp;simpler&nbsp;solutions,
  anyway. There were some problems with getting the local environment up and running
  and the Drupal installed. Luckily my fiancé was around to help me with those issues.
  He is an expert with Docker and pretty much all kinds of things on the server-side.</p><p>The
  difference came when it was time to host the sites. I outsourced the hosting setup
  to my fiancé. He fought with the setup for days, trying to make it as&nbsp;good&nbsp;as
  possible without too many compromises. For the Gatsby it was just to put the built
  site to the same server, no special setups needed. The difficulties with the Drupal
  site were mostly because of PHP. I had originally planned&nbsp;to set up&nbsp;the
  Gatsby version on&nbsp;Netlify, but&nbsp;he suggested it could coexist with the
  Drupal site. That way I could also better see the differences in the sites' speed
  and all those juicy bits. It was a good idea so that became the plan.</p><p>I was
  already planning on continuing my Gatsby experiences with this blog so I figured
  I'd host this on Netlify instead. I like that they offer to build my site for me,
  all I need to do is update my repository. And I'd been reading about people creating
  their portfolios etc and hosting them on Netlify so I was a bit curious about the
  process.</p>"
