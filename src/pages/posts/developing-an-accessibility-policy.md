body: <p>When you start creating guidelines/policies for your company on accessibility,
  there are a lot of things to do. First, everyone will need to get onto the same
  page. They need to know why things will be done differently and how. It isn't enough
  if developers or content creators take accessibility into account if designers and
  marketing ignore it. Good accessibility requires everyone. And requiring everyone
  to be able to handle accessibility, the staff will need to be trained.</p><p>There
  are a lot of misconceptions about accessibility. Like accessibility is only for
  the disabled people or accessibility takes away all the nice things and you end
  up with ugly designs and boring websites. You can have a lot of nice visual effects
  and designs just as before. Poor contrast not only affects people with vision impairments
  but also for example people using older devices. This is one reason why you might
  benefit from raising awareness on accessibility on a more general level.</p><h2>Think
  about creating an accessibility team</h2><p>Depending on the size of your company,
  it might be a good idea to have a whole team dedicated at least partly to accessibility.
  The team should get a deeper understanding of accessibility and the WCAG (Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines) 2 criteria so they can support the rest of your staff
  regarding any questions or issues. The accessibility team can also handle staff
  trainings after they themselves have received training, of course.</p><p>At the
  company I work at, an accessibility team has been created and I am one of three
  members in the team. We will be responsible for staff training, and we'll be creating
  our company's accessibility guidelines together with company management. We've mostly
  studied accessibility on our own, but we recently had the chance to talk with an
  accessibility specialist and ask him all our questions about the WCAG criteria or
  accessibility in general. We learned a lot; it was super helpful to have someone
  teach us. I really recommend providing such an option for your firm's accessibility
  team, if possible.</p><p>Having proper guidelines will help your company maintain
  a more stable level of accessibility as well as help your workers have a clearer
  understanding about their responsibilities.</p><h2>Conformance</h2><p>The accepted
  level in many countries is level AA. I think achieving level AA is not too difficult,
  I would recommend always aiming for it. But make sure you check what the requirements
  are in your country. It's also good to remember that you don't need have everything
  immediately 100% accessible. Set realistic deadlines and, if necessary, tackle accessibility
  in smaller steps.</p><p>And remember, you should also always update your policies
  and guidelines. </p><p>There are a lot of resources on the matter, but here are
  two good pages I came across while writing this blog post:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/org-policies/"
  title="">Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility</a> has excellent
  info on how to develop organizational policies in practice.</p></li><li><p>On how
  to start bringing accessibility up in your company, check out <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/4-steps-to-get-accessibility-on-your-companys-agenda-db9d0b48a029"
  title="">4 steps to get accessibility on your companyâ€™s agenda</a>.</p></li></ul><p>I
  would also like to remind you that accessibility is about inclusivity, it's really
  time to stop neglecting people.</p>
