body: <p>I've combated with exhaustion a few times now. </p><p></p><p></p><p>I pretty
  much always cancelled my own plans if a deadline was approaching, whether or not
  the situation was "my fault" or not.</p><p></p><h2>The revelation I had about things
  this spring</h2><p>I've recently read and heard more and more about impostor syndrome.
  And then it suddenly clicked. One of the biggest reasons I was pushing myself too
  hard was due to thinking that otherwise I wasn't good enough because I wasn't the
  most technical and experienced developer. I kept comparing myself to people who
  have over double years in expertise. When you think about it, it makes sense that
  those people would have better technical skills and knowledge. But what took me
  a long while to finally understand was that I do have a lot of value in other areas,
  maybe even more than the people I was comparing myself to. Of course comparing yourself
  to others to begin with is not a very sensible thing to do, but I suppose that comes
  quite naturally to us. At least in my family, us kids were constantly compared to
  one another and the habit stuck when I grew up.</p><p>But the proper revelation
  came when I started thinking about my past from this context. My impostor syndrome
  gained a ton of momentum from my childhood. I grew up in an environment where my
  value was next to nothing. I won't go into detail about that, but it has definitely
  left a mark on me. Bullying at school and a broken family were in the center of
  everything and I ended up depressed as a teen. Thankfully my best friend helped
  me get through things back then.</p><p>I also graduated at a bad time in 2008, the
  economy was quite bad at the time, and it took me two years to finally get a job.
  I suffered from depression again while unemployed, and I blamed myself for not being
  able to land a job sooner. It's really a little silly, because I was a junior without
  much experience and was competing for the junior spots with people that were basically
  closer to seniors. Of course most places chose to hire the more experienced applicants.
  And the longer the unemployment became, the more convinced I became of not being
  good enough. And when I finally got the job, I worked extra hard because I was constantly
  afraid I wasn't good enough.</p><p></p>
