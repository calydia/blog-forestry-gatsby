body: <p>I grew up in an environment where my value was next to nothing. I won't go
  into detail about that, but it has definitely left a mark on me.</p><p>I graduated
  at a bad time, the economy was quite bad at the time, and it took me two years to
  eventually finally getting a job. I suffered depression while unemployed, and I
  blamed myself for not being able to land a job sooner. It's really a little silly,
  because I was a junior without much experience and was competing for the junior
  spots with seniors. Of course most places chose to hire the more experienced applicants.
  And the longer the unemployment became, the more convinced I became of not being
  good enough.</p><p>I pushed myself way too hard because I somehow convinced myself
  that otherwise I wasn't good enough.</p><p>I pretty much always cancelled my own
  plans if a deadline was approaching, whether or not the situation was "my fault"
  or not. </p><p></p>
