body: <p>I've combated with exhaustion a few times now. I've only recently&nbsp;realised&nbsp;that
  my impostor syndrome and my past affect the problem way more than I thought.</p><p>I've
  spent a lot of time this spring and summer thinking about exhaustion and impostor
  syndrome and how things relate to one another. I think I finally learned my lesson
  in this matter.</p><h2>How things end up from good to horrible</h2><p>It usually
  starts with me noticing that I have too much stuff put on my plate and I can't stop
  it from getting worse or make things any easier. I try saying no to extra work,
  but then I often end up&nbsp;taking the offered work anyway because of reasons like
  "there's no one else" or "it just has to be done" or "we're all busy". I'm not saying
  that those sentences aren't true, because they&nbsp;are. I've noticed that there
  basically always is someone who is at least almost at their breaking point. Those
  sentences just make me feel like I'm not being heard or being taken seriously. I
  used to think&nbsp;it was my fault that the workload kept piling on, that maybe
  I wasn't fast enough or talented enough because not everyone was at their breaking
  point. Thankfully I've&nbsp;realised&nbsp;that those things have nothing to do with
  this. It's just my impostor syndrome talking and some people have a more healthy
  point of view to work vs private life than I've had. I've always put the company
  and its clients above my wellbeing. And that mistake is mine alone.</p><p>One seemingly
  harmless behaviour of mine is that I pretty much always cancel my plans if someone
  wants to have a meeting at an inconvenient time. This, at first, seems like it doesn't
  matter, it's only one time. But then it happens again and again and again. It becomes
  a pattern, and&nbsp;it disrupts my personal life more than you'd think. I haven't
  taken this behaviour as seriously as I should have done a long time ago.</p><p>When
  the deadlines&nbsp;close&nbsp;in, I usually start working longer days automatically&nbsp;to
  try&nbsp;to somehow get everything done. This ultimately leads to a situation where
  I don't have time or the energy to exercise or&nbsp;do anything else either. For
  example, my fianc√© was telling me all spring that it's weird and a shame that I
  don't teach myself anything new or do anything tech-related in my spare time anymore.
  And the only answer I could give was that I just don't have the energy for it. And
  we've had the similar conversations before, this wasn't the first time I've driven
  myself to exhaustion.</p><p>But even so,&nbsp;when I&nbsp;see the symptoms happening,
  I don't think it will end up as bad as the previous time or I just dismiss it because
  things need to get done whatever it takes. I haven't taken this issue seriously&nbsp;enough.
  Maybe if I finally start taking this as seriously as I should, I can affect my workload
  better, too. Nobody at the workplace wants things to get as bad for me as they've
  gotten this spring, I'm sure of it. So maybe if I&nbsp;take&nbsp;the first symptoms
  seriously myself, other people will too. And maybe then I can ask for help a little
  sooner, it would be nice to get help before things go too far.</p><h2>The revelation
  I had about things this spring</h2><p>I visited a rival company this spring, or
  I suppose it was summer. I talked to a developer who said that he would feel sad
  if he wouldn't be able to concentrate on a site or a task for a longer&nbsp;period
  of&nbsp;time. He wouldn't want&nbsp;to&nbsp;work on several projects in one day.
  That's when I first&nbsp;realised&nbsp;that I&nbsp;actually&nbsp;felt the same way.&nbsp;That&nbsp;I
  had&nbsp;to hop&nbsp;between projects (maybe not even getting to work two hours
  on each) was one&nbsp;reason&nbsp;I felt the workload so badly.&nbsp;At that time
  I&nbsp;put my foot down and told my project managers that the two projects they
  had me working at the same time would have to be split into days or weeks for each
  and that I wouldn't be even discussing the other project while I was working on
  the other. And they were fine with it. And I noticed that it was a lot easier to
  get things properly done when I could&nbsp;concentrate on what I was doing and not
  constantly being interrupted mid-thought.&nbsp;The&nbsp;best way for me would have
  been to do one&nbsp;project&nbsp;first and then move on to the next. But this weekly
  split was an&nbsp;ok&nbsp;solution. I'm definitely keeping this system up from now
  on. But if I hadn't had this discussion, I probably wouldn't have&nbsp;realised&nbsp;that
  this was even something I needed.</p><p>I've recently read and heard more and more
  about impostor syndrome. Before I just thought it was me that was thinking&nbsp;this
  way. It was&nbsp;kind&nbsp;of relieving to see many talented and smart people saying
  they were combatting the same thing. And then it suddenly hit me. One of the biggest
  reasons I was pushing myself way too hard was&nbsp;because of&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;otherwise,
  I wasn't good enough because I am not the most technical and experienced developer.
  I kept comparing myself to people who have over double the years in expertise. When
  you think about it, it makes sense that those people would have better technical
  skills and knowledge. But what took me a long while&nbsp;to understand&nbsp;was
  that I&nbsp;have a lot of value in other areas, maybe even more than the people
  I was comparing myself to. And that my technical skills have value even if I'm not
  the most experienced.&nbsp;Comparing&nbsp;yourself to others, to begin with, is
  not a very sensible thing to do, but I suppose that comes&nbsp;naturally to us.
  At least in my family, we kids were constantly compared to one another, and&nbsp;the
  habit stuck when I grew up.</p><p>But the proper revelation came when I started
  thinking about my past in this context. My impostor syndrome gained a ton of momentum
  from my childhood. I grew up in an environment where I grew to believe my value
  was next to nothing. I won't go into much detail about that, but it has definitely
  left a mark on me. Bullying at school and a broken family were in the centre of
  everything and I even ended up depressed as a teen. Thankfully my best friend helped
  me get through things back then because she was the only one who took my mental
  health seriously. She put a stop to my harmful habits the moment she&nbsp;realised&nbsp;what
  was happening. Without her, I probably wouldn't be here today.</p><p>I also graduated
  at a bad time in 2008, the economy was&nbsp;quite&nbsp;bad&nbsp;and it took me two
  years&nbsp;to get&nbsp;a job. I suffered from depression again while unemployed,
  and I blamed myself for not being able to land a job sooner. It's a little silly
  because I was a junior&nbsp;with little&nbsp;experience and was competing for the
  junior spots with people that were closer to seniors.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;places&nbsp;hired&nbsp;more
  experienced applicants, and that makes sense. But that wasn't something I&nbsp;could&nbsp;get
  through to my head. The longer the unemployment became, the more convinced I became
  of not being good enough. I've always been shy and uncertain of myself, both of
  which got worse&nbsp;for&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;I didn't deserve a job or&nbsp;not being
  good enough. And when I finally got the job, I worked extra hard because I was constantly
  afraid someone would tell me I didn't have what it takes. And I've been doing that
  for almost ten years now. I think&nbsp;it's finally time that I convince myself
  that I'm good enough, I&nbsp;have&nbsp;value and&nbsp;I deserve to be in the position
  I'm in. On the good days, I&nbsp;know this. But when things got dark, my brain&nbsp;convinced&nbsp;me
  otherwise. I hope&nbsp;from now on my brain will listen to reason even if the situation
  gets worse.</p>
