image_alt_text: First impressions of Gatsby
body: '<p>The installation was super easy. I''ve used Gatsby a few times now, and
  I''ve had no issues in the installation process. I''ve used the Hello World starter
  and the Forestry-tweaked blog starter so far.</p><p>Gatsby''s documentation is excellent
  and newbie-friendly. They even have <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/"
  title="">tutorials</a> from setting up to site publishing. They also have very active
  people on, for example, Twitter. They answer a lot of questions people have about
  Gatsby.</p><p>I also like how instructive Gatsby is, for example, if the commands
  develop, serve, or build won''t run because of an error. It was easy to fix typos
  and newbie mistakes when you received instant and clear feedback from the command
  line. No more wondering what "error occurred" might mean.</p><p>Gatsby has a ton
  of plugins you can install from data sources to sitemaps and RSS feeds and just
  all kinds of things, really. People constantly create new plugins and update the
  old ones. You can search for the plugins on the Gatsby site and they provide you
  with detailed installation and usage instructions. The people at Gatsby have put
  effort into the documentation and usage instructions. I''m a huge fan of clear and
  precise instructions, so I think Gatsby looks like a perfect match for me.</p><h2>My
  favorite plugin so far: Gatsby-image</h2><p>Gatsby''s image functionalities were
  one reason I was so eager to try out Gatsby. And I was not disappointed! With just
  a few plugins, I could get responsive lazy-loading images on my site. I don''t even
  know all the magic that happens behind the scenes, but I''m just amazed at how easy
  they are to use and how good the results are.</p><p>I also like the sass plugin
  because I got to use nesting and mixins. Installation and usage couldn''t get any
  easier, just install the plugin (and node-sass) and start writing.</p><h2>What I''ve
  created so far with Gatsby</h2><p>I have only been able to use Gatsby on my own
  projects. The first project I created with Gatsby was <a href="https://sanna.ninja"
  title="">my portfolio</a>. It uses a Drupal backend. I have also created this blog
  as a practice project, and this uses a Forestry backend. I also created another
  blog project with WordPress as its backend, but it is not released yet.</p><p>My
  blog is hosted on Netlify. I had read that Netlify was easy to use, but I was surprised
  how easy it was to set up everything, all required steps and settings were well
  documented and instructed. I really recommend also checking out Netlify! My portfolio
  is hosted on Kubernetes and the hosting is in the skillful hands of my fianc√©. Neither
  of the sites had difficulties with getting Gatsby builds to work.</p><p>Because
  all of these sites of mine have been small and simple, I hope I get the chance to
  use Gatsby professionally as well someday. I''d like to see what kind of magic can
  be created with Gatsby with a bit more complex projects. I''ll also probably have
  something more to say about Gatsby after I''ve used it more, but I''m really liking
  it so far. I can''t wait to create more projects with it.</p>'
