body: "<p>I first heard of Netlify while attending a React course. The instructor
  recommended using Netlify for all small projects we would make. At the time I didn't
  check into Netlify that much but I remembered the name. 6 months later I set up
  my account.</p><p>Setting up my account was fast and super easy. You can sign up
  with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or email. The UI is very user-friendly and easy to
  navigate. I also like how the UI looks, which is a nice plus. Netlify offers good
  documentation and user instructions, which is something I love. It didn't take much
  time to start actually using the service.</p><p>When searching for small Gatsby
  site hosting alternatives, there didn't seem to really be any other than Netlify.
  And after using Netlify, I easily understand why. You can get a site up and running
  in no time and you automatically get a Netlify sub-domain for your site. You can
  also use a custom domain if you don't have one yet, Netlify can help you buy one
  and set it up. I had my own custom domain and I had no problems setting it up because
  the instructions were so clear.</p><h2>What I have on Netlify</h2><p>I only have
  my blog site running on Netlify at the moment but I will definitely use Netlify
  when I have more projects.</p><p>I set up my site to deploy from GitHub automatically,
  so that whenever my repository changes, Netlify will build my site for me. The site
  set up couldn't really get much easier. I don't have to worry about anything with
  the deploys, as soon as the Gatsby build is finished, my blog is updated. And if
  there is an error in the build process, I still have my site up and I can see the
  error message from Netlify and fix the problem.</p><p>When I look at my site's information,
  I can easily see when the most recent production deploy has been successful. The
  deployment status changes in real-time, which is a nice way to see when my changes
  go up. </p><h2>Other useful Netlify features</h2><p>Netlify also offers Active Split
  Testing by splitting traffic to multiple branches. I haven't had the need for split
  testing but I find this amazing. I believe many people benefit from this.</p><p>Netlify
  also supports automatic collection of form submissions from any HTML forms on the
  site. I currently don't have any forms on my sites but this is one feature that
  really caught my eye when looking at all the possibilities Netlify offers.</p><p>Netlify
  Identity helps you manage sign-ups, logins, etc. I very briefly tried this out while
  testing Netlify CMS and the feature was just as easy to set up as Netlify in general.
  They provide you with instructions for each step.</p><p>And there are even more
  features listed on the site. I really recommend you check out Netlify!</p>"
