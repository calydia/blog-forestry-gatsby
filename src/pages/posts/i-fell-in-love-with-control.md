body: <p>I know I’m a bit late to the party, but I recently played through Remedy’s
  action-adventure game Control. I was immediately impressed with the graphics; I
  really like how the game looks and feels. The atmosphere is fantastic.</p><p>I was
  also immediately hooked to the janitor, Ahti, who uses a lot of translated Finnish
  idioms. Ahti is portrayed by Finnish actor Martti Suosalo, who did excellent work
  with the character! I could fangirl all day about the character. I also like the
  fact that they used Finnish music in the game. I added the song Take Control by
  the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard to my Spotify playlist, and each time the
  song plays, I get an instant urge to play the game again. I really liked the part
  of the game where this song was playing. Funnily enough I had some difficulties
  getting through that part, so I ended up listening to the song quite a few times
  while playing.</p><p>I also really liked the story. The idea behind it was great
  and I was instantly hooked to the game itself. I must admit, though, that at first
  my fiancé had to mostly play the game because the eerie environment really creeped
  me out at the beginning. Luckily, I got over it and could play myself as well. But
  even that aspect got me impressed with Remedy’s abilities, I rarely get creeped
  out in any game except with things that trigger my trypophobia.</p><p>I had a blast
  trying to find all the references to Finnish language or Finland in general and
  I couldn’t help to think how the game would feel to someone outside Finland. What
  would the Ahti’s translated Finnish idioms sound like and if people are able to
  understand anything he says. </p><p>There were a few times we were basically screaming
  at the game because a battle or an event was so difficult but luckily always quite
  soon you could hear Ahti talk again and all was better again. The difficulty of
  the game was good apart from some really challenging battles.</p><p>We started playing
  the game at a great time, because the first DLC was released while we were playing
  the original content and we could continue with The Foundation DLC straight after
  finishing the main game. Now it feels like it's taking forever for the second DLC
  to release, even though it should be released already in summer 2020.</p><p>I totally
  recommend the game. I first bought the game on a disc but conveniently the Deluxe
  edition was on sale at PSN store while I was playing the game and I wanted to buy
  it. First of all, I prefer digital games over the discs but also the Deluxe edition
  had some gear and other vanity things to offer. With it, you will also receive the
  first two expansions. After the current situation allows me to go visiting my parents
  again, I will definitely take the Control disc to my stepfather, who also loves
  to play games. I might even persuade my mom to try it out just because of Ahti,
  the janitor.</p><p>If you wish to find out more about the game, you can check out
  the <a href="https://controlgame.com/" title="">Control website</a>. There are a
  lot of reviews and gameplay videos around the web, as well, you don't have to take
  just my word on it.</p>
