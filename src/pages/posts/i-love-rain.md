image_alt_text: Rain hitting a metal surface
body: <p>It's been raining almost the whole day today. When it was pouring, I ran
  to the balcony to watch and listen to the rain. It makes me happy. I can always
  feel my mood switching when it starts raining. The best rain is autumn rain, the
  weather is getting colder, and it gets dark in the evenings. Those just make the
  rain feel even more special.</p><p>I remember always loving the rain. When I was
  little, I would often run outside when it was raining. Back then I didn't have to
  worry about my hair colour coming off.</p><p>I share my love for the rain with my
  cat Lumia. She seems to love the larger raindrops, she often joins me on our balcony
  to watch the rain. We also share a fascination for thunderstorms. My fianc√© often
  laughs at us when I just go watch the storm with Lumia and we can spend a long time
  just watching and listening.</p><p>If I don't want to listen to music while I work
  (or if music would be too intrusive), I often go to a site which allows me to play
  thunderstorm sounds. Some also give options to switch what surface the rain is hitting.
  There are services like <a href="https://rainymood.com/" title="">Rainy Mood</a>,
  and there are several playlists on Spotify and tons of videos on YouTube. And to
  make sure that cats get enough attention in this post, there's also <a href="https://purrli.com/"
  title="">Purrli</a>. Cat purrs are also soothing. Someone should create a site where
  we could combine cat purrs with rain and nature sounds.</p><p>I love going outside
  for a walk after a storm has ended. The air is so pure and it just feels amazing
  to breathe. I don't mind going outside when it's raining either, as long I just
  have a big enough umbrella. I love listening to the rain hitting the umbrella. I
  usually listen to music while I walk to work but if it's raining, I'll just listen
  to the rain. I probably should get a clear umbrella so I could also see the rain
  better.</p><p>I love autumn, period. I love being able to put a coat on and not
  sweat after five seconds. The colours of the leaves are also very soothing for me.
  I'm just generally at my happiest during autumns. Summer is too hot for me, spring
  has me swell up because of pollen and usually winter switches between +5 and -5
  constantly, which causes my skin to break. Autumns are just perfect. Especially
  on rainy days.</p>
