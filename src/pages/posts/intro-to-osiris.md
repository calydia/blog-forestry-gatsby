body: "<p>Osiris (Fi*Neaera's Finian Fahd) is an 8-year-old beige Abyssinian. He was
  born in FI*Neaera's Abyssinian Cattery with 4 siblings.</p><p>He loves everything
  and everyone, except scary things. He tends to scare easily, especially nowadays.
  He had to live a long period with renovations happening all around him in the building,
  and all the noises and weird and sudden visitors left a mark on him, I think.</p><p>Osiris
  is the most loving cat I've ever had. He would probably like to have a cat friend
  he could love and lay on top of, but unfortunately, our Lumia doesn't want love
  from him.</p><p>Osiris also likes to take part in almost all the activities happening
  in our apartment. You can only do&nbsp;stuff without help when he is asleep.</p><p>One
  of his pet peeves is closed doors, only the front door and the balcony door may
  remain closed. If someone closes a door, he will soon open it and complain.</p><p>Osiris
  loves food. He always runs to the kitchen if we go there. Just to see if he could
  get something to eat.</p><p>He has suffered of FORL for many years, and because
  of it he has only a few teeth remaining. Which makes him even cuter.</p>"
