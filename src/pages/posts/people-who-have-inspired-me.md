body: '<p>When I finally got my tech spark back and started activating on the tech
  side of things, I also started to follow many people on Twitter. I thought I''d
  write this post about those people and where you can find them in case you want
  to update your follow list.</p><p>The Ladybug Podcast: <a href="https://ladybug.dev/"
  title="https://ladybug.dev/">https://ladybug.dev/</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LadybugPodcast"
  title="https://twitter.com/LadybugPodcast">https://twitter.com/LadybugPodcast</a>
  Great podcasts about tech. I also follow the Ladybug Podcast hosts separately.</p><p>Kelly
  Vaughn is a super fun woman whose Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly" title="https://twitter.com/kvlly">https://twitter.com/kvlly</a>
  is filled with humour and her store at <a href="https://kvlly.com/shop" title="https://kvlly.com/shop">https://kvlly.com/shop</a>
  is filled with hilarious products, some of which I will need to order at some point.
  Personal favourites are the Snack Overflow fanny pack, I laughed out loud at this
  one for a long time. Also World''s Okayest Developer and Full Snack Developer gave
  me chuckles. If you like stickers, mugs, mousepads and t-shirts, check her store
  out!</p><p>Emma Wedekind has Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind"
  title="https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind">https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind</a> filled
  with humour and tech info.</p><p>Ali Spittel <a href="https://twitter.com/ASpittel"
  title="https://twitter.com/ASpittel">https://twitter.com/ASpittel</a> also spreads
  humour and tech.</p><p>Jason Lengstorf has an excellent series called Learn with
  Jason. He has people come on and they go through how to do things, for example,
  on Gatsby. <a href="https://ladybug.dev/" title="https://ladybug.dev/">https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf</a>
  I also follow him on Twitter <a href="https://ladybug.dev/" title="https://ladybug.dev/">https://twitter.com/jlengstorf</a>
  . He has written an excellent blog post about being more positive <a href="https://lengstorf.com/how-to-be-positive/"
  title="https://lengstorf.com/how-to-be-positive/">https://lengstorf.com/how-to-be-positive/</a>,
  which resonated with me. And he seems to be a great guy in general so check his
  blog and Twitch series out!</p><p>I found Laurie Barth <a href="https://twitter.com/laurieontech"
  title="https://twitter.com/laurieontech">https://twitter.com/laurieontech</a> from
  one of Jason''s Learn with Jason episodes. She was such a fun person and her Twitter
  is filled with articles she''s posted (she has a ton of stuff directed at newbies,
  which I think is awesome!) and all kinds of other tech-related things. </p><p>On
  a company level I follow Linus Tech Tips <a href="https://twitter.com/LinusTech"
  title="https://twitter.com/LinusTech">https://twitter.com/LinusTech</a> I like their
  style and they have several amazing hosts with a superb sense of humour.</p><p>If
  you have any people in mind who I should start following, please send me links at
  twitter! I want to get my Twitter filled with inspirational tech people to help
  me stay motivated and involved in the newest technologies. Naturally I''m also interested
  in inspirational people in general, not all has to be about tech.</p>'
