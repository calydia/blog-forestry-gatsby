body: '<p>When I finally got my tech spark back and started activating on the tech
  side of things, I also started to follow many people on Twitter. I thought I''d
  write this post about those people and where you can find them in case you want
  to update your follow list.</p><h2>Podcasts</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LadybugPodcast"
  title="">The Ladybug Podcast</a>: Great podcasts about tech.</p><p>I also like Red
  Hat''s <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes" title="">Command
  Line Heroes</a>.</p><h2>People</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly" title="">Kelly
  Vaughn</a> is a super fun woman whose Twitter is filled with humour and <a href="https://kvlly.com/shop"
  title="">her store</a> at  is filled with hilarious products, some of which I will
  need to order at some point. Some of my personal favourites are the Snack Overflow
  fanny pack, I laughed out loud at this one for a long time. Also World''s Okayest
  Developer and Full Snack Developer gave me chuckles. If you like stickers, mugs,
  mousepads and t-shirts, check her store out!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind"
  title="">Emma Wedekind</a> has Twitter filled with humour and tech info, so does
  <a href="https://twitter.com/ASpittel" title="">Ali Spittel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf"
  title="">Jason Lengstorf</a> has an excellent series called <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf"
  title="">Learn with Jason</a> on Twitch. He has people come on and they go through
  how to do things, for example, with Gatsby. He has written an excellent <a href="https://lengstorf.com/how-to-be-positive/"
  title="">blog post about being more positive</a>, which resonated with me. And he
  seems to be a great guy in general so check his blog and Twitch series out!</p><p>I
  found <a href="https://twitter.com/laurieontech" title="">Laurie Barth</a> from
  one of Jason''s Learn with Jason episodes. She is such a fun person and her Twitter
  is filled with articles she''s posted (she has a ton of stuff directed at newbies,
  which I think is awesome!) and all kinds of other tech-related things.</p><p><a
  href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo" title="">Sarah Drasner</a> has written a post
  about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/"
  title="">how to start contributing to open source project</a>.</p><h2>Companies</h2><p>On
  a company level I like to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/LinusTech" title="">Linus
  Tech Tips</a>. I like their style and they have several amazing hosts with a superb
  sense of humour.</p><p></p><p>If you have any people in mind who I should start
  following, please send me links at twitter! I want to get my Twitter filled with
  inspirational tech people to help me stay motivated and involved in the newest technologies.
  Any inspirational or great personalities in general also apply here, not everything
  has to be about tech.</p>'
