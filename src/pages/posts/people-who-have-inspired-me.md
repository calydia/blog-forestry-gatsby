body: <p>When I finally got my tech spark back and started activating on the tech
  side of things, I also started to follow many people on Twitter and Twitch. I thought
  I'd write this post about those people and where you can find them in case you want
  to update your follow list.</p><p>The Ladybug Podcast:&nbsp;<a href="https://ladybug.dev/"

  an excellent series called Learn with Jason. He has people come on and they go through
  how to do things, for example, on Gatsby.&nbsp;<a href="https://ladybug.dev/" title="https://ladybug.dev/">https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf</a>&nbsp;I
  also follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://ladybug.dev/" title="https://ladybug.dev/">https://twitter.com/jlengstorf</a></p>
