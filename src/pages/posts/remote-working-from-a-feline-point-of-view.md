body: "<p>I posted about the positives and the negatives of remote working for me.
  This is the version which includes the cat behaviours to the mix.</p><p>The cats
  usually sleep most of the day, so they rarely create distractions. When they do,
  I can take my eyes off the screen for a moment and maybe take an anti-stress cat
  petting break. I sometimes notice not taking any break from the screen for hours
  (the recommendation is to take at least one break an hour to give your eyes a break
  from the screen staring) so I think it's a positive thing when they interrupt me
  for a moment. Besides, I don't only have to pet them, I can also use them as rubber
  ducks while giving them a little attention.</p><p>Lumia often sleeps in the same
  room with me, she can take a nap behind the laptop in her own specific spot or then
  she might sleep behind me on the couch. When she's behind the laptop, I can constantly
  get the cat image looking effect because I can see her from the corner of my eye.</p><p>Lumia
  can sometimes decide that she wants food. Now. And it doesn't matter if there is
  still food on the cups because that food is bad (even if it is her favourite). She
  will walk specifically on top of the laptop touchpad because she will definitely
  need to get to the other side of the laptop. She usually hits the touchpad with
  at least two paws, which is how I know she does this on purpose. She will then sit
  next to the laptop with her back turned against me so she can move her tail on the
  laptop keyboard and be annoyed when I touch the tail. Hard to avoid touching when
  I often have my hands on the keyboard when she does this. Luckily usually this happens
  when I could use a break anyway so I just feed her and continue working. So this
  is a little negative behaviour, but it rarely happens at a time where I couldn't
  anyway take a bathroom break or fill my water bottle.</p><p>Osiris also sometimes
  wakes up if I start talking (which usually means a meeting). He might come running
  and say hello. But I see this only as a funny thing, if someone takes offence to
  it, maybe they should think about their priorities in life. Besides, it doesn't
  happen nearly as often as it should. My fianc√© might have a little different story,
  though. He used to work in the kitchen before we bought a separate remote working
  desk. So he would take part in the meetings in the kitchen. And the kitchen means
  food for Osiris. Which means he'll get excited and start meowing. Sometimes quite
  a lot. So on over more than one occasion, his coworkers got to ask if that was a
  cat they heard.</p><p>We nowadays order most of the cat food online and the store
  uses home delivery. It's nice to be able to receive the packages while remote working
  and not having to go to the post office. The package is often heavy, so it's also
  nice for the delivery person to get rid of it after first walking up to the third
  floor we live in. The post offers a service where the package can be left behind
  our door but I prefer to get the package inside because I don't trust people.</p><p>Orisis
  often pukes after eating if he hasn't been fed in 12 hours or so. Unfortunately,
  I've had to test this on several occasions. Because of this, remote working is a
  huge plus because then I can work longer hours, if needed, and still be able to
  feed the cats immediately after they tell me they want food. The cats should not
  suffer because of any bad project schedules.</p><p>Sometimes the cats are both awake
  and they will run around the house together. The sound of them running always makes
  me happier so that also improves my mood while I'm working. Being able to spend
  more time at home really reminds me of what's important.</p>"
