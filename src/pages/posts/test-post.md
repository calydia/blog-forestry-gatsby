body: "<p>Lumia (FI* Tanssikatti Lumihiutale) is an 8-year-old brown Sacred Birman.
  (I would like to say at this point that she got her name before Nokia released their
  phones.) She has no siblings, and I think that is visible in her personality. She
  has quite the temperament.</p><p>She will never up, I don't think she knows how
  to. Thankfully Osiris usually surrenders. But when they have their power struggles,
  Lumia won't give up even if she's losing.</p><p>Lumia has a funny voice and she
  tends to use it if she wants something. I think she likes to confuse us by sometimes
  just meowing for no particular reason. Sometimes she does this very long and weird
  meow, which at the beginning caused Osiris to run to check up on her (as well as
  us humans of course, because everyone thought there was something wrong).</p><p>Lumia
  is a stunning cat, but she doesn't act like a lady. And she definitely doesn't sound
  like one.</p>"
