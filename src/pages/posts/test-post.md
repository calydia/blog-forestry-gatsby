body: "<p>Lumia (FI*&nbsp;Tanssikatti&nbsp;Lumihiutale) is an 8-year-old brown Sacred
  Birman. (I would like to say at this point that she got her name before Nokia released
  their phones.) She has no siblings, and I think that is visible in her personality.
  She has quite the temperament. Her temperament is one of the&nbsp;reasons&nbsp;I
  love her so much. I'll dive deeper into this at some point.</p><p>When she first
  moved in with us, she was definitely my kitten. But after Osiris moved in, she became
  my fiancé's cat. For a&nbsp;period of time&nbsp;I think she ranked me below her
  in our family's order of precedence.&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;I&nbsp;think she might
  have changed her mind about that.</p><p>She will never give up, I don't think she
  knows how to. Thankfully Osiris usually surrenders. But when they have their power
  struggles, Lumia won't give up even if she's losing. And recently we had a situation
  where things got too far, at least we think so. Humans will intervene sooner&nbsp;if
  that happens again. People always say that humans shouldn't intervene and I&nbsp;believe
  that unless things&nbsp;get&nbsp;a bit too real.&nbsp;It's our job to keep them
  safe.</p><p>Lumia has a funny voice, and&nbsp;she&nbsp;uses&nbsp;it if she wants
  something. I think she likes to confuse us by sometimes just meowing for no particular
  reason. Sometimes she does this very long and weird meow, which at the beginning
  caused Osiris to run to check up on her,&nbsp;and&nbsp;us humans, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;because
  everyone thought there was something wrong, but no, she was just meowing about something.
  In the beginning, she wouldn't meow at us, she went to another room to voice her
  concerns about life. But when my fiancé was abroad for a while, I tried to teach
  her that if she meows at me, I will instantly give her food (Food is one&nbsp;thing&nbsp;she
  most often meows about). I've been told that this was a horrible mistake because
  now she meows at my fiancé constantly. But I find it hilarious.</p><p>Lumia is a
  stunning cat, but she doesn't act like a lady. And she definitely doesn't sound
  like one.</p><p>Lumia likes to take part in everything. Even if it's scary, then
  she just goes a little further away to watch what's happening.&nbsp;</p><p>Her breed
  description says Sacred Birmans get along well with other animals and that they
  like humans and children etc. This is not the case with Lumia. She has once met
  a baby and she was absolutely terrified. She likes to hang around people if they
  don't touch her. There are only a few people she seems to actually like. And she
  used to hate my mother, now she seems to tolerate my mother a bit better. Lumia
  often starts to wiggle her tail when she hears her voice and she often turns her
  back on my mother if she approaches. Lumia is so docile that she would never do
  anything but I find it funny that she has so clear feelings about someone.</p><p>I
  think Lumia loves Osiris in her own way. She doesn't want to sleep close to him
  but they often play together and she sometimes washes Osiris' head if they are begging
  for food. And if Osiris doesn't see the signs when she wants him gone, she bites
  him in the neck. And Osiris just continues rubbing against her after she lets go.</p>"
