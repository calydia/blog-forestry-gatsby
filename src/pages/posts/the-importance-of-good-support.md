body: "<p>The feeling of not having anyone to talk to about things that are bothering
  you is awful. I felt like this growing up, I only had one friend I was able to confide
  in. She was amazing, but it would have been important to have someone to talk to
  at home as well. I feel like I currently have a quite good support network, and
  my experiences have made me appreciate my network more than I can put to words.</p><p>For
  mental health, it's extremely important to get help if you need it. Other people
  might also notice the behaviour changes earlier than the person having difficulties.
  This makes support network's value priceless.</p><h2>Support at home</h2><p>People
  closest to you will usually be the first to notice symptoms of exhaustion or changes
  in your well-being. If I'm moody or tired I can easily blame the flu or a bad night
  of sleep. If it becomes more of a pattern, I might still be blaming these kinds
  of things but people around me can see that there's more to it than just a few bad
  nights of sleep.</p><p>Support at home doesn't have to necessarily be your partner,
  it can also be a family member or a friend. Each person has different relationships
  with people. My main support is my fiancé, I can tell him absolutely anything. He
  is also the first to notice changes in my sleep patterns or if I start skipping
  the gym or other hobbies. This is something that coworkers cannot know unless I
  specifically tell them, which makes it even more important to have support at home.</p><p>After
  struggling with my mental health, I've tried to make sure I tell my fiancé everything
  I can to make sure he has the best knowledge of my current mental state. I know
  this isn't the easiest or nicest task for him to have, but I appreciate that he
  is willing to help. I think I've proven to myself twice now that I do need help
  from other people.</p><h2>Support at work</h2><p>It's important to have support
  at work as well. If you have too much on your plate, it's crucial that you have
  people around you who you can tell this to. That way things can get resolved before
  it's too late. If things go too far, it's much harder to bounce back to your regular
  self, and it takes longer.</p><p>My situation definitely went too far this spring.
  Luckily the month before my summer holiday was quiet around the office. That helped
  me reduce my worst symptoms before starting my holiday. I had agreed to reduce my
  flexible hours to zero, which made my summer holiday a bit over five weeks in total
  instead of the normal four weeks. I definitely needed this longer break to recover.
  After getting back to work again I've noticed feeling a lot more like myself. And
  people around me have noticed it as well.</p><h2>My support network in action</h2><p>Because
  of what happened this spring and how bad it got, I've had a lot of discussions with
  people about exhaustion, mental health and what to do when things start going wrong.
  The discussions themselves have been extremely helpful and it's been relieving to
  be able to talk about this to people. I grew up having to hide pretty much everything
  related to feelings and mental health, so this new openness has been amazing.</p><p>I
  also, kind of as a joke, made a deal with my fiancé that he will tell me immediately
  if he notices me starting to spiral or getting exhausted. Previously I've had trouble
  admitting these things when I first start showing symptoms, which is why I told
  him he can also remind me of my stubbornness to admit things are going wrong. I
  told about this deal of ours to my superior at work and we then made a deal that
  if I get notified of exhaustion at home, I will let him know as well, whether I'm
  willing to believe it's happening or not. Let's hope I will never need to test these
  deals but it's still nice to know they exist.</p><p>In the spring at the worst moments,
  I felt like nobody cared about my situation and I felt completely helpless because
  of it. I knew it really wasn't true but I couldn't convince myself otherwise. Which
  is why it's amazing to have all these conversations I can remind myself of if I
  ever start to feel that way again.</p><h2>Improving my mental health</h2><p>It's
  very important that I learn to recognise and accept my symptoms as early as possible
  so I can prevent things from escalating and ask for help sooner. Let's hope things
  won't go anywhere near that far ever again, but if things start getting worse, I
  think I have a lot more tools and supporting people at my disposal this time.</p><p>I
  believe I've realised a few of my most harmful personality traits in this regard
  and now I can monitor them a little better. It's funny how a quite harmless trait
  becomes toxic if combined with some other traits. This is something I haven't taken
  seriously until now. I definitely need to continue working on my impostor syndromes,
  my other insecurities and my habit of basically sabotaging my own mental health
  by setting myself goals I cannot reach or by being the most unforgiving towards
  myself no matter what the issue is.</p><p>I have a lot of work to do on my mental
  health but I'm slowly getting better. One thing I really need to learn to do is
  to listen to my body. And I need to start forgiving myself. Baby steps.</p>"
