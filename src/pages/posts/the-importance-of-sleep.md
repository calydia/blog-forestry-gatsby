image_alt_text: My cat, Osiris, sleeping
body: "<p>The importance of sleep is constantly mentioned everywhere. Yet many people
  end up getting too little sleep, myself often included. I've seen how much better
  I get when I sleep properly with a consistent schedule but still I often get too
  little sleep.</p><p>Normally I'm not able to get 8 hours of sleep on many nights
  per week, usually, it ends up between 7 or 7 and a half hours, sometimes even less.
  I know this is not enough for me in the long run. Sleep has been one of the first
  things I give up when I feel the need to push myself to the limit at work. I need
  to stop doing that because I often get a headache if I don't sleep enough or well
  enough. It's usually not a migraine but the headache still gets so bad that sometimes
  it's hard to function, especially after working all day.</p><p>Then there's the
  fact that I'm a light sleeper, I wake up easily. If my fianc√© has a rough night,
  most likely so will I. Thankfully our cats tend to sleep at night and not run around
  the apartment. Osiris likes to sleep between my legs and Lumia between our pillows.
  If I have a rough night, so will they. I'm so used to them sleeping next to me that
  if some night they sleep elsewhere, I have trouble falling asleep. Both cats sometimes
  like to sleep under the covers, Lumia will wake me up to let her in, Osiris will
  poke his way in himself. He does usually also wake me up too, though, because I
  can feel his cold nose moving around while he's trying to wiggle his way under the
  covers.</p><p>I notice hitting the snooze button more often if I'm constantly getting
  too little sleep. I can easily snooze for 30 minutes or more even though I know
  that is bad.</p><h2>My brain likes to make falling asleep hard</h2><p>If I know
  that I will be thrown into a situation I really can't prepare for, I usually sleep
  poorly the night before because my brain likes to go through all kinds of scenarios.
  And then there are the situations where something unpleasant happens during a day
  and I feel like I should have said something (either just said something in general
  or said something different; I think you know what I mean), my brain picks up at
  night again and start creating its scenarios. It makes letting things go more difficult,
  and it makes my next day feel worse.</p><p>I've tried pretty much everything to
  get rid of this but I suppose my brain is just wired that way. I've always had a
  good imagination, even as a child. Therefore I always want to prepare for new situations
  as well as I can, because I don't want to lose sleep because of them.</p><h2>Finally
  getting enough sleep after a long period of time</h2><p>I slept around 8-10 hours
  a night for the first couple of weeks at the start of my 5-week summer holiday.
  And my sleep rhythm didn't shift at all. Usually, my sleep rhythm is shifting almost
  immediately. So I suppose there was quite a lot of tiredness in my body. After 3
  weeks I felt my sleep rhythm starting to shift.</p><p>Thankfully I now have a bed
  I can sleep 8 hours on without my back killing me. In my previous bed my back could
  start hurting after 6 hours of sleep, and that, of course, makes getting enough
  sleep much harder.</p><p>After going through what I did this spring, proper sleep
  is something that I will need to prioritise. Especially since I've noticed how much
  better I feel after a well-rested night. I also want to keep reducing my migraine
  triggers and just be more healthy. So in the upcoming months, I'll be snooze and
  sleep schedule training.</p>"
