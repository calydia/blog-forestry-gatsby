body: <p>Ever since I first saw the demos and YouTube videos of people playing the
  game, I knew I had to have it at some point. As an office worker with hobbies revolving
  around sitting on a computer, I knew I needed to&nbsp;give&nbsp;more&nbsp;movement&nbsp;to
  my arms and shoulders. I'd been thinking about starting up tennis or badminton but
  I've yet to start those. But this game works as a great substitute.</p><p>If you
  don't know what I'm talking about, check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://beatsaber.com/"
  title="">Beat Saber website</a>. You can also search for&nbsp;Beat Saber&nbsp;on
  YouTube, there are tons of videos of people playing the game. Some are on such a
  skill level where I just stare at them with my mouth open.</p><p>I love dancing,
  singing and gaming so this game pretty much combines them all for me.&nbsp;My&nbsp;singing
  and dancing&nbsp;have nothing&nbsp;to do with the gameplay itself but I&nbsp;have&nbsp;so
  much fun that I&nbsp;do&nbsp;both&nbsp;almost immediately.</p><p>The game is super
  fun&nbsp;and&nbsp;it also gives you a decent cardio workout, of course,&nbsp;it
  all depends on the intensity you play the game with.</p><p>I play the game with
  Oculus Quest, which we purchased earlier this summer. I wish my play area was&nbsp;wider;&nbsp;the
  area is&nbsp;less than what is recommended. But if I don't go&nbsp;totally&nbsp;berserk,
  the area is&nbsp;quite&nbsp;alright. I rarely hit anything in my surroundings, but
  the Oculus&nbsp;gives&nbsp;me visual warnings about the grid area from time to time.</p><p>One
  of the biggest problems with me playing the game is, of course,&nbsp;the cats of
  the house. They want to&nbsp;take part,&nbsp;so&nbsp;one or both will come lay on
  my feet or next to my feet. I can still play, but I&nbsp;need to be&nbsp;careful
  so I won't step on them or kick them. My fianc√© hasn't tried the game yet, so we
  don't know how much participation he gets from the cats, but I&nbsp;think&nbsp;the
  cats&nbsp;take part&nbsp;more with me.</p><p>But in all seriousness, the real challenge
  for me with this game is that I have trouble registering the cubes in my peripheral
  vision and the more cubes in my vision area&nbsp;in general,&nbsp;the more real
  trouble I have of&nbsp;actually&nbsp;registering what I should be doing. I hope
  that by playing this game I will get my eyes to get used to these kinds of movements
  and might&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;progress to more difficult levels later on.</p><p>I
  like that&nbsp;Beat Saber&nbsp;has a campaign with different&nbsp;kinds of&nbsp;challenges.
  It helps keep the game more interesting. You can add those challenge types to any
  songs in the game yourself too. It's also great that the game has several difficulty
  levels. It helps people with different skill levels or physical shape to&nbsp;play
  the game and enjoy it. I've tried&nbsp;a few&nbsp;expert levels so far, and some
  of them just had me stop the level immediately and say no way. I'll give those levels
  another go when I've played&nbsp;more and am more familiar with the level styles.
  Challenging yourself is one fun thing in the game.</p><p>One complaint people have
  had is that the songs in the game don't have that much variation. If you dislike
  computer music, you might not enjoy the songs so much. But there are&nbsp;many&nbsp;people
  creating their own levels with a wider range of songs and you can add those to your
  game. There are in-game purchases for songs, though there aren't that many of those
  yet. The game creators have said there will be more variation in the music and that
  they will keep making the game better and better. I&nbsp;like the music styles in
  the game, though, so I have no complaints.</p><p>I ordered Oculus Quest prescription
  lens adapters so I might&nbsp;play without my glasses. The experience felt weird
  at first because I felt like I was more in the game. With my glasses, I&nbsp;could
  always&nbsp;see the area around me&nbsp;quite&nbsp;well because I had to leave room
  for my glasses. Somehow the blocks seemed to be a lot&nbsp;closer&nbsp;to me. But
  once I played&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;levels, I got used to it. The blocks were&nbsp;a
  bit sharper&nbsp;than before, so I suppose my glasses were always a little dirty,
  even if I cleaned then just before playing.</p><p>I mention in the title that the
  game is addictive. After I first played the game, I woke up the next morning thinking
  about when I could play the game again. The songs were playing in my head and I
  just wanted to&nbsp;start moving&nbsp;my arms around. And this continued after I
  played the second time. And the third time. I just fell in love with the game.</p><p>I
  really recommend trying the game out if you have the gear for it. There is also
  a free demo available if you don't want to buy the game without testing it yourself.
  The game is not expensive and the game just got a free update with new songs and
  features.</p>
