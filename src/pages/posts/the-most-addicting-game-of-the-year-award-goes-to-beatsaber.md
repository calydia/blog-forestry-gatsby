body: <p>Ever since I first saw the demos and YouTube videos of people playing the
  game, I knew I had to have it at some point. As an office worker with hobbies revolving
  around sitting on a computer, I knew I needed to start giving more specifically
  movement to my arms and shoulders. I'd been thinking about starting up tennis or
  badminton but I never came around to it. But this game works as a great substitute.</p><p>If
  you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the <a href=" https://beatsaber.com/"
  title="">Beat Saber website</a>. You can also search for Beat Saber on YouTube,
  there are tons of videos of people playing the game. Some are on such a skill level
  where I just stare at them with my mouth open.</p><p>I love dancing, singing and
  gaming so this game pretty much combines them all for me. Of course, my singing
  and dancing don't have anything to do with the gameplay itself but I find myself
  having so much fun that I start doing both of those almost immediately.</p><p>The
  game is super fun and it also gives you a decent cardio workout, of course it all
  depends on the intensity you play the game with.</p><p>The game just got a free
  update with new songs, but I haven't yet had time to test it. I did install it today
  though, so maybe since this is my last summer holiday week, I could spend the rest
  of the week having fun with the new songs and features they launched.</p><p>I play
  the game with Oculus Quest, which we purchased earlier this summer. I wish my play
  area was a bit wider, the area is a bit less than what is recommended. But if I
  don't go totally berserk, the area is quite alright.</p><p>One of the biggest problems
  with me playing the game is, of course, the cats of the house. They want to participate,
  which means that one or both will come lay on my feet or next to my feet. I can
  still play, but I do need to be a bit careful so I won't step on them or kick them.
  My fianc√© hasn't tried the game yet, so we don't know how much participation he
  gets from the cats, but I do think that the cats participate more with me.</p><p>I
  like that Beat Saber has a campaign with different kinds of challenges. It helps
  keep the game more interesting. You can add those challenge types to any songs in
  the game yourself too. It's also great that the game has several difficulty levels.
  It helps people with different skill levels or physical shape to be able to play
  the game and enjoy it. I've tried a couple of expert levels so far, and some of
  them just had me stop the level immediately and say no way. I'll give those levels
  another go when I've played a bit more and am more familiar with the level styles.
  Challenging yourself is one fun thing in the game as well. It might get boring if
  everything was super easy.</p><p>One complaint people have had is that the songs
  in the game don't have that much variation. If you dislike computer music, you might
  not enjoy the songs so much. But there are a lot of people creating their own levels
  with a wider range of songs and you can add those to your game. There are in game
  purchases for songs as well, though there aren't that many of those yet. The game
  makers have said there will be more variation in the music and that they will keep
  making the game better and better. I do like the music styles in the game, though,
  so I have no complaints about the music.</p><p>I even ordered Oculus Quest prescription
  lens adapter so that I might be able to play without my glasses.</p><p>I mention
  in the title that the game is addictive. After I first played the game, I woke up
  the next morning thinking about when I could play the game again. The songs were
  playing in my head and I just wanted to start moving my arms around. And this continued
  after I played the second time. And the third time. I just fell in love with the
  game. I really recommend trying it out if you have the gear for it. There is a free
  sample available.</p>
