body: "<p>Ever since I first saw the demos and YouTube videos of people playing the
  game, I knew I had to have it at some point. As an office worker with hobbies revolving
  around sitting on a computer, I knew I needed to start giving more specifically
  movement to my arms and shoulders. I'd been thinking about starting up tennis or
  badminton but I never came around to it. But this game works as a great substitute.</p><p>I
  love dancing, singing and gaming so this game pretty much combines them all. Of
  course my singing and dancing don't have anything to do with the game itself but
  I find myself having so much fun that I start doing both of those almost immediately.</p><p>The
  game is fun and it also gives you a decent cardio workout, of course it all depends
  on the intensity you play the game with.</p><p>The game just got a free update with
  new songs, but I haven't yet had time to test it. I did install it today though,
  so maybe since this is my last summer holiday week, I could spend the rest of the
  week having fun with the new songs and features they launched.</p><p>I play the
  game with Oculus Quest, which we purchased earlier this summer. I  wish my play
  area was a bit wider, the area is a bit less than what is recommended. But if I
  don't go totally berserk, the area is quite alright.</p><p>One of the biggest problems
  with me playing the game is of course the cats of the house. They want to participate,
  which means that one will come lay on my feet or next to my feet. I can still play,
  but I do need to be a bit careful so I won't step on them or kick them. My fianc√©
  hasn't tried the game yet, but I do think that the cats participate more with me
  than with him.</p>"
