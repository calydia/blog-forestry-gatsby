body: "<p>Osiris, as many Abyssinians are, is a very smart cat. He is actually the
  first cat of mine who is submissive to humans (he was also very submissive with
  Lumia in the beginning). If he thinks he's made me angry, he will immediately lie
  down on his back and meow at me. That always makes me laugh and I have to give him
  pets and kisses.</p><p>Lumia bows to no one. If I tell her no, she will start wiggling
  her tail and maybe scoff at me. She will look at me and let me know that I am being
  a mean and a stupid human. She usually obeys though, but she will make it clear
  that she is only doing this because she feels like it. But luckily you don't have
  to tell her no to many things, she rarely does things she shouldn't do. Most often
  I tell her no when she tries to hop into my closet when I open the door to put clothes
  in. She would very much like to lie in the clean soft clothes. She likes all the
  closets though unless she gets permission to go in. Then the closets are boring.</p><h2>Words
  the cats know</h2><p>Osiris also knows a few words, which he also obeys. He knows
  what 'down' means, he knows he is supposed to hop down to the floor from wherever
  he is. This he obeys easily from either of us.</p><p>A word he properly obeys only
  from me is 'come'. I can get him to come to me no matter what is happening, at least
  so far. If he is running towards an open door and I tell him to come, he will come.
  If he sees a bee and I tell him to come, he will leave the bee and come to me. It's
  very useful. My fiancé can't get him to obey as often. I think it's because of the
  tone. I will say the word with a higher than normal voice and if I want to make
  sure he comes, I will say it excitedly. My fiancé can't get the same effect through
  to Osiris. We've tested this on quite a few occasions and I always get the cat,
  my fiancé only sometimes. This word is something we actively started to teach him
  as soon as I first noticed that Osiris might understand what we want from him. I
  sometimes practised with him alone, taking a few of the freeze-dried chicken bits
  with me without Osiris noticing and telling him to come. And then he would receive
  a reward. He responds quite well to treat rewards because he likes to eat. Then
  we sometimes did this together with my fiancé, we both would have treats and one
  of us would tell Osiris to come and give him his reward and then the other would
  do the same. And now Osiris knows the word really well.</p><p>Lumia doesn't really
  respond to words as well as Osiris does. But she learns things. She has a habit
  of vanishing to sleep somewhere. Sometimes I will worry and I will need to find
  her, for example, I won't start the washing machine before I locate her. And sometimes
  I will press the button, realise I'm not 100% sure of where she is and that's when
  I definitely need to locate her. I know she's not in the washing machine but I just
  need to see her. I will search all her known hiding places while calling for her
  and if I don't find her on the third search around the house, I think I will start
  sounding desperate. That when she usually appears from somewhere, I just turn around
  and there she sits on the floor. So she recognises my anxiety and comes to me when
  she knows I'm in this state. I always try to give her a few treats for showing up
  so she might learn that it's a good idea to show herself when being called.</p><h2>Kitchen
  habits</h2><p>When they are waiting to get food, Osiris runs around. He will run
  between Lumia and the humans, constantly meowing and brushing against everything
  and everyone. Lumia hates this behaviour. She will tolerate his closeness for a
  moment, might even wash his head for a few seconds, and then she will lose her temper
  and bite him or hit him with her paws (no nails though). Osiris just waits until
  he is loose again from her grip and continues like nothing just happened. Lumia
  would just want to sit and wait in front of her cup in peace.</p><p>Lumia also thinks
  about whether she will eat the food (unless she's super hungry). When she is thinking,
  we will pet her and tell her to eat. She will often start eating. Sometimes not
  and she will make a game of it and runs away (more on this subject a little later).
  If either of us doesn't pet her after setting their cups down, Lumia will look at
  us expecting her pets.</p><p>We've taught the cats that they will not receive any
  food that isn't cat food (apart from the raw meats once in a while). Lumia doesn't
  really care at all about our plates or anything (she might sniff one, but she isn't
  interested). Osiris, on the other hand, likes to lick any plates that might be around.
  Which means he will hop on to the kitchen counter, walk across our stove and over
  the sink to the plates. Our stove makes beeping noises if it detects something on
  it. So we will hear the beeping. All it takes is to shout out 'cat' and we hear
  him hopping down. A few seconds later he appears in the doorway to look at us. Well,
  we did already know who was on the stove but he doesn't seem to realise that he
  is basically telling us he did it by appearing. Lumia sometimes steps on the stove,
  but her fur in her paws is so long that she rarely triggers the beeping.</p><h2>Weird
  games and favourite toys</h2><p>Lumia loves to run away from me. I will creep up
  close to her, make a certain noise I've taught her (a sound I only make while we
  are playing so she knows what it means) and try to pet her or touch her. She sprints
  to another room and I will chase after her and again try to pet her. And then we
  repeat the process until one of us gets tired. My fiancé has tried to play this
  game and Lumia will often think he is seriously chasing her. But I think it's nice
  that we have our own game between us.</p><p>Lumia loves to play on the bed. She
  likes to do a miniature version of our chasing game by hopping on the other side
  of the bed when I try to touch her and then I will have to move all around the bed
  to get to the other side to touch her and this will again be repeated for a while.
  For some reason, I magically cannot just touch her on the other side without moving
  to the other side.</p><p>Then Lumia likes to chase hands under the covers or sheets
  (but only when we are playing this game, at night our hands and feet can move).
  Though often she will be passive which means the hands will chase her, and she hops
  around the bed. She has this way too adorable way to move her head from side to
  side when she will attack the hand. Osiris used to play this game too but nowadays
  he is too scared. We might do a little light version with him but it just isn't
  the same, even to him.</p><p>I've tried to buy them a lot of different toys but
  they don't seem to like anything much. Osiris loved the first feather stick toy
  we got him as a kitten and then I ordered more of the same kind once it broke down.
  He was terrified of the new toys. But luckily the toys found a new home with my
  coworker's cat, who loves that kind of toys.</p><p>Osiris responds to toys with
  catnip, I've got him a couple of soft toys. He doesn't seem to bite them much anymore
  though, he immediately stops after shaking the toy. I think it might be because
  he has so little teeth left. But then he just gets very drunk and walks away. Or
  he might just sit and stare at nothing. Lumia doesn't really respond to catnip,
  she always checks the new toys out but she doesn't usually play with them.</p><p>Lumia
  loves all kinds of strings. Shoelaces she gets regularly and they are fantastic.
  Also, my coworker brought her some strings that were thicker, she loves to bite
  those. I have winter boots that break shoelaces rather quickly, we now have a habit
  with Lumia that she will join me when I change the shoelaces. After I'm done, she
  gets the old ones to play with. She loves to chase the strings and sometimes she
  will just want to watch them move. The latter is quite tiring for us humans since
  we put some effort into the string movements. But when she chases after it, it's
  amazing. She makes these cute hops around the string and attacks and runs away and
  attacks again. Her fluffy fur makes her movements so cute it melts my heart to watch
  her. Osiris didn't like strings before he noticed that Lumia liked them. And now
  he likes them too.</p><p>They have one favourite toy. They used to love this one
  feather toy we call a bird toy. It has more and longer feathers than those feather
  stick toys. They love to chase it. And after my brother showed that he had used
  a fishing rod to make a cat toy, we decided to try the same. We bought a children's
  fishing rod and attached the feathers from that feather toy to it. The cats love
  it.</p><p>Both cats like boxes and bags. Both also like to play in them, you can
  move your finger on the outside of the bag and get bites and paws. Osiris especially
  plays gently when he knows the human fingers (or toes) are at play. He was taught
  by his breeder very well not to bite on an early age. Lumia, on the other hand,
  isn't that gentle with us. But her breeder didn't teach her at all about not biting
  people. When we went to get her on her 13th week, she was constantly eating my fingers.
  But funnily enough, Lumia rarely bites Osiris, it's the other way around. Except
  in the kitchen but that's only to tell him to stop bugging her.</p><p>It's just
  hard to play with them both since Osiris is always aggressively playing after joining
  the fun and then Lumia will stop playing, observe for a while and go away. Osiris
  will always join all the toy games around the house which results in Lumia not getting
  to play as much. Which is why it is even nicer to have a few games only Lumia will
  play.</p>"

  bags?
