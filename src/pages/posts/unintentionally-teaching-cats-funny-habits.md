body: "<p>There have been a few occasions when I've noticed teaching something to
  my cats that weren't really our intention.</p><p>Lumia loves both minced meat and
  treats(they love frozen dried chicken). But sometimes she doesn't want to bother
  going to the kitchen for them. Which often ends up with Osiris first running to
  her because she's not coming even though her name is constantly being called. Then
  either of us humans usually carries her to the kitchen, and she then eats happily.
  So one of the funny habits we've ended up teaching her is getting a ride to the
  kitchen if she's too lazy to walk there herself.</p><p>Lumia also requires minced
  meat to be warm enough. So basically when we prepare minced meat, instead of giving
  it to them straight away, the meat is preheated for her. It isn't enough that the
  meat isn't cold; it has to be a nice temperature. Osiris really doesn't care, he
  would eat it no matter the temperature.</p><p>Osiris pretty much loses his mind
  every time a container is opened in the kitchen. He is used to getting minced meat
  and sometimes chicken. And now he expects that every container has food for him.
  It can sometimes get annoying when he screams and jumps and climbs all over the
  kitchen but usually, it's just funny.</p><p>We switched to electric armchairs in
  our living room. Usually, the cats come and lay between our legs. And if I have
  a cat, I don't want to get up because I will feel bad for shooing the cat. We solved
  this by whenever one of us needed to get up, the other would first give treats to
  the cats. So the cats would get up and we wouldn't have to move them. This has led
  to a situation where Lumia always runs to the kitchen table if one of us gets up
  from the chairs. It doesn't matter if she wasn't even on the chair. She has learned
  that when someone gets up from the chair; she gets treats. And it's been so hilarious
  that we've kept giving her the treats. She eats so little food that it can be a
  good thing that she eats her daily chicken bits. What's also funny is that Osiris
  hasn't picked this habit up.</p><p>We humans have this habit of snorting if something
  is funny or disappointing (don't know if snorting is the word for this but it's
  the best I could come up with). Lumia has picked this habit up, and she always snorts
  if we ignore her or if something disappoints her. The best thing about this is the
  fact that she does this in situations where humans would. I don't know how and when
  she picked this habit up, but we've done everything we can to make her keep expressing
  herself with snortings.</p><p>Osiris, like many other Abyssinians, can open doors.
  My fiancé kept saying Lumia was stupid because she can't open doors. I believe that
  she just doesn't bother. Because when, for example, the toilet door is closed, and
  she wants to get in, she goes behind the door and starts scratching the door. If
  no human will open the door, usually Osiris comes from wherever he was sleeping,
  jumps on the door handle, opens the door for her and leaves. Why on earth would
  she try jumping with her long fur and try to hang from the handle when she can always
  just be a damsel in distress.</p><p>I think Lumia has also picked up that if she
  wants something from my fiancé and he is not responding to her, she can annoy me
  and I will make things happen. This can be witnessed how she behaves when we sit
  on our computers. We have three tables next to each other, there's my fiancé's table,
  then there is our remote working table and then last but not least there's my table.
  Lumia hops on my fiancé's table and eventually, he picks her up and sets her on
  the floor. But no worries, she doesn't give up! She runs next to me and hops on
  my keyboard and mouse and then runs to my fiancé. He then again picks her up and
  sets her on the floor. And then this just continues until either he gives in or
  I get annoyed and tell them to stop. After that, my fiancé usually gives in to her
  wishes. Sometimes I will just go give her whatever she wants after she starts bossing
  him. This is behaviour most often is related to food. She either is hungry and there
  isn't food in their cups or she just doesn't like what's in the cups. When the situation
  is the latter, we try not to give in to her straight away because the food is fine.
  She's just super picky and can just some days decide that her favourite food is
  now bad and will not touch it.</p><p>If she wants things from you while you're on
  your computer, she comes and sits where ever you're trying to look. She knows that
  we want to see something on our screens. I've tested this by moving whatever I was
  trying to watch next to her and when she notices what's happened, she will move.
  While she sits, she stares at you very intensely. I often take advantage of these
  situations because when she wants things, she lets me love her and she rubs against
  me. Usually, when she sits down, she snorts. And sometimes if sitting isn't enough,
  she will come stand over your keyboard making sure she's not stepping on any keys,
  because stepping on keys gets you back on the floor. While she stands, she stares
  just as intensively and can sometimes snort. She rarely meows at me but is she's
  doing this to my fiancé, she will often meow at him. And at that point, she usually
  breaks him because he ends up laughing and then she knows she has won. I've tried
  to actively teach her the habit of coming to ask for things she wants instead of
  meowing in another room so basically this habit of hers is completely my fault.
  I didn't expect her to abuse this power so much!</p><p>If Lumia comes to sit next
  to you while you're on your computer, she usually sits rather nicely next to the
  keyboard. Which is why I let her sit there and might even pet her. This usually
  happens after I've shooed Osiris away from my keyboard. Because he just cannot sit
  without pressing the spacebar or something equally annoying. And then he looks accusingly
  at me from the floor when I pet Lumia.</p><p>Lumia likes to lie down between your
  keyboard and your screen. Which wouldn't be a problem if she didn't start leaning
  on the keyboard. My fiancé printed a protector for his top-level keys but I haven't
  yet gotten mine. So she presses buttons. Mostly F10 to F12. Which makes my browser
  will start behaving rather wild. I originally thought she didn't do this on purpose
  but once or twice I have given her more space and she couldn't lean on the keys
  anymore. And then I heard a snort. So this lady is doing this on purpose after all!</p><h2>Habits
  that they've taught each other or they've picked up&nbsp;on their own</h2><p>Lumia
  has always liked to bite toilet brushes. I suppose she uses them to brush her teeth.
  She doesn't eat dry food at all so she doesn't have many tools at her disposal.
  She does also like to press her teeth through some packing materials that seem to
  feel nice against her teeth. But back to the toilet brushes. Disgusting habit, right?
  We've always had to have the brush that we used locked up in a closet because I
  wouldn't want her biting into whatever horrible things the toilet brush collects.
  I once noticed that Stockmann was selling a toilet brush with a rather tall porcelain
  container. We went to pick it up and the saleswoman suggested that why not give
  her her own toilet brush after we told her Lumia's story. We ended up giving Lumia
  the previously purchased unused toilet brush and she's still occasionally biting
  it. We thought that the previous purchase we had made had had a container big enough
  to prevent her from taking the brush and we even put obstacles in her way. Apparently
  she thought of them as a challenge and she had fetched that brush in a matter of
  hours. So nowadays there is a random toilet brush on the floor. We wash her brush
  from time to time to make sure it doesn't get too dusty. But that toilet brush with
  the porcelain container has been a success, she cannot get to the brush even if
  she tries to.</p><p>Lumia sometimes is seen lying on her back with her front paws
  cutely on her chest. She seems to be wanting something when she does this. But what's
  funny about this habit is that she doesn't say anything so we don't know when she
  does this. We just, at some point, notice that there she is again. This habit is
  something that Osiris has learned from Lumia, though he doesn't go fully on his
  back, more on his side. He usually does this when he just wants some pets. Both
  are super cute when they do this.</p><p>Osiris has learned that it's smart to not
  start eating straight away. He always checks if Lumia will start eating. For some
  reason, he seems to think that if Lumia won't eat, they will get something better.
  Yeah, they will, but it will take hours because we don't like wasting food. Their
  eating habits are also quite different. Lumia most often takes a few bites and comes
  back to take a few bites a bit later. Osiris eats as much as he will eat, he starts
  eating from his cup and after Lumia first leaves, he will switch to her cup to eat
  all the jellies or sauces. So he basically sucks the meat pieces and puts them back.
  Osiris also usually doesn't want to touch the old food after an hour or two maximum.
  Lumia, on the other hand, will eat the foods even if they've been in the cups for
  a bit longer.</p>"
