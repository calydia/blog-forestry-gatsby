body: "<p>There have been a few occasions when I've noticed teaching something to
  my cats that weren't really our intention.</p><p>Lumia loves both minced meat and
  treats(they love frozen dried chicken). But sometimes she doesn't want to bother
  going to the kitchen for them. Which often ends up with Osiris first running to
  her because she's not coming even though her name is constantly being called. Then
  either of us humans usually carries her to the kitchen, and she then eats happily.
  So one of the funny habits we've ended up teaching&nbsp;her&nbsp;is getting a ride
  to the kitchen if she's too lazy to walk there herself.</p><p>Lumia also requires
  minced meat to be warm enough. So basically when we prepare minced meat, instead
  of giving it to them straight away, the meat is preheated for her. It isn't enough
  that the meat isn't cold; it has to be a nice temperature. Osiris really doesn't
  care, he would eat it no matter the temperature.</p><p>Osiris pretty much loses
  his mind every time a container is opened in the kitchen. He is used to getting
  minced meat and sometimes chicken. And now he expects that every container has food
  for him. It can sometimes get annoying when he screams and jumps and climbs all
  over the kitchen but usually, it's just funny.</p><p>We switched to electric armchairs
  in our living room. Usually, the cats come and lay between our legs. And if I have
  a cat, I don't want to get up because I will feel bad for shooing the cat. We solved
  this by whenever one of us needed to get up, the other would first give treats to
  the cats. So the cats would get up and we wouldn't have to move them. This has led
  to a situation where Lumia always runs to the kitchen table if one of us gets up
  from the chairs. It doesn't matter if she wasn't even on the chair. She has learned
  that when someone gets up from the chair; she gets treats. And it's been so hilarious
  that we've kept giving her the treats. She eats so little food that it can be a
  good thing that she eats her daily chicken bits. What's also funny is that Osiris
  hasn't picked this habit up.</p><p>We humans have this habit of snorting if something
  is funny or disappointing (don't know if snorting is the word for this but it's
  the best I could come up with). Lumia has picked this habit up, and she always snorts
  if we ignore her or if something disappoints her. The best thing about this is the
  fact that she does this in situations where humans would. I don't know how and when
  she picked this habit up, but we've done everything we can to make her keep expressing
  herself with&nbsp;snortings.</p><p>Osiris, like many other Abyssinians, can open
  doors. My fiancé kept saying Lumia was stupid because she can't open doors. I believe
  that she just doesn't bother. Because when, for example, the toilet door is closed,
  and she wants to get in, she goes behind the door and starts scratching the door.
  If no human will open the door, usually Osiris comes from wherever he was sleeping,
  jumps on the door handle, opens the door for her and leaves. Why on earth would
  she try jumping with her long fur and try to hang from the handle when she can always
  just be a damsel in&nbsp;distress.</p><p>I think Lumia has also picked up that if
  she wants something from my fiancé and he is not responding to her, she can annoy
  me and I will make things happen. This can be witnessed how she behaves when we
  sit on our computers. We have three tables next to each other, there's my fiancé's
  table, then there is our remote working table and then last but not least there's
  my table. Lumia hops on my fiancé's table and eventually, he picks her up and sets
  her on the floor. But no worries, she doesn't give up! She runs next to me and hops
  on my keyboard and mouse and then runs to my fiancé. He then again picks her up
  and sets her on the floor. And then this just continues until either he gives in
  or I get annoyed and tell them to stop. After that, my fiancé usually gives in to
  her wishes. Sometimes I will just go give her whatever she wants after she&nbsp;starts
  bossing&nbsp;him. This is behaviour most often is related to food. She either is
  hungry and there isn't food in their cups or she just doesn't like what's in the
  cups. When the situation is the latter, we try not to give in to her straight away
  because the food is fine. She's just super picky and can just some days decide that
  her favourite food is now bad and will not touch it.</p><p>If she wants things from
  you while you're on your computer, she comes and sits where ever you're trying to
  look. She knows that we want to see something on our screens. I've tested this by
  moving whatever I was trying to watch next to her and when she notices what's happened,
  she will move. While she sits, she stares at you&nbsp;very&nbsp;intensely. I often
  take advantage of these situations because when she wants things, she lets me love
  her and she rubs against me. Usually, when she sits down, she snorts. And sometimes
  if sitting isn't enough, she will come stand over your keyboard making sure she's
  not stepping on any keys, because stepping on keys gets you back on the floor. While
  she stands, she stares just as intensively and can sometimes snort. She rarely meows
  at me but is she's doing this to my fiancé, she will often meow at him. And at that
  point, she usually breaks him because he ends up laughing and then she knows she
  has won. I've tried&nbsp;to actively teach&nbsp;her the habit of coming to ask for
  things she wants instead of meowing in another room so basically this habit of hers
  is completely my fault. I didn't expect her to abuse this power so much!</p><p>If
  Lumia comes to sit next to you while you're on your computer, she usually sits rather
  nicely next to the keyboard. Which is why I let her sit there and might even pet&nbsp;her.&nbsp;This
  usually happens after I've shooed Osiris away from my keyboard. Because he just&nbsp;cannot
  sit without pressing the spacebar or something equally annoying. And then he looks
  accusingly at me from the floor when I pet Lumia.</p><p>Lumia likes to&nbsp;lie&nbsp;down
  between your keyboard and your screen. Which wouldn't be a problem if she didn't
  start leaning on the&nbsp;keyboard.&nbsp;My fiancé printed a protector for his top-level
  keys but I haven't yet gotten mine.&nbsp;So&nbsp;she&nbsp;presses&nbsp;buttons.
  Mostly F10 to F12. Which makes&nbsp;my browser will start behaving rather&nbsp;wild.
  I originally thought she didn't do this on purpose but once or twice I have&nbsp;given
  her more space and she couldn't lean on the keys anymore. And&nbsp;then&nbsp;I heard
  a snort. So this lady is doing this on purpose after all!</p>"
