body: <p>I don't think there is a single person who is good at everything. Someone
  might be an amazing developer with the knowledge of probably several coding languages
  and seems to be just a wizard in general. Someone is fantastic at frontend development,
  someone at backend development, and then there are people who do both quite comfortably
  but can often lack some of the superb skills someone who specializes in one more
  specific area might have. Someone might be a great communicator with no difficulties
  in communicating with people. Someone might be superb at organizing things, like
  tasks and priorities. Someone might be an excellent documentation writer. Someone
  likes to mastermind the solution architecture, while someone else might be more
  comfortable with someone else making those kinds of decisions. Someone might have
  great ideas but have difficulties in putting them to technical solutions. Someone
  might have amazing technical ideas but have difficulties in "selling" them to their
  marketing team. I could go on for days with examples, but I think you get the idea.
  We all have things we excel at, things we're great at, good at, ok at... etc.</p><p>Trying
  to excel at everything can be exhausting. This is where teams come in and why teams
  are such a good thing. If the teams are constructed in a way that comprises people
  with different skill sets and abilities, the results can be amazing. Where one person
  lacks a skill, someone else on the team has that skill and fills in. With teams,
  it's also possible to let someone skip doing some tasks they don't like, especially
  if there is someone else who enjoys doing those tasks. Forcing everyone to do everything
  is really not that smart. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, preferences,
  and dislikes. Taking advantage of each team member's strengths is crucial. It might
  not be possible to have everyone only do things they love, but if we know what each
  member likes and dislikes, it's a lot easier to make sure everyone gets to do the
  things they like on a more frequent basis.</p><p>I've worked both alone and as a
  part of a team, and I prefer working as a team. We get to decide together how we
  want to do things, and I think it's good that we have more people, because more
  people means different ideas and perspectives. It's easier to be more inclusive
  when you have more diversity. Each team member brings something important to the
  table.</p><h2>Value yourself</h2><p>I used to think I was worth much less than someone
  who has 10 more years of experience than me. Especially when this was also more
  or less implied by other people. But I'm glad I've come to realize that that simply
  is not true. I have a lot of skills this other person doesn't have. We both are
  valuable workers, just in a little different way. This realization has improved
  my mental health a lot, it has reduced the constant nagging in my head that I'm
  not worth enough. It's easy to say that don't compare yourself to other people,
  it's a whole another thing to actually not do it. I admit I still do it sometimes,
  but nowadays I have a more healthy approach to it. For example, I think about a
  colleague that wow this person is so much better at x than I am. I can learn so
  much from this person just by watching them work, and I wonder if they would be
  willing to even teach me at some point. So I'm doing the comparison from the perspective
  from my growth possibilities, not from the perspective that I'm worth less than
  them for not knowing something.</p><p>Having a negative self-image professionally
  can make it harder to improve your skills and find your own path. If you are in
  an environment where you aren't valued for who you are, try to find a safer place
  for you to grow. And always remember to value your own skills! There most likely
  aren't many people who have the same skillset you have, which makes you quite unique.</p>

meta_description: Don't forget to value yourself and your skillset. Stop comparing
  yourself to other people in a negative way.
